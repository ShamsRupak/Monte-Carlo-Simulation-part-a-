# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-part-a-
Write a function in MATLAB that estimates the value of pi using a Monte Carlo simulation (see below). The function should take as input the number of points to use in the simulation and output the estimated value of pi. Write the function using element-wise operations and logical variables; do not use a "for" loop.
